# Machine Learning for a Sustainable Future Predicting National Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to predict national greenhouse gas emissions. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns, machine learning models can be trained to predict future emissions. **Problem Statement:**
*Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to climate change and its associated impacts, such as sea level rise, more frequent and severe weather events, and changes in ecosystems and biodiversity.*

**Business Understanding of the project**


*   Businesses can have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions through their operations, supply chains, and products.


*   Understanding Greenhouse gas emissions is critical for businesses to make informed decisions about sustainability, risk management, and long-term viability. 

*  Comprehensive understanding of the sources and impacts of emissions across the entire value chain, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal. 


*   Compliance with regulatory requirements to reduce emissions, such as carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes.


*  Reducing emissions can lead to cost savings, increased efficiency, and improved brand reputation.
